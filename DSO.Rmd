# Read in Dataset and Load Libraries
```{r, echo=TRUE}
setwd("C:/Users/Chelsea Lee/Dropbox/Kaggle Stuff/Titanic")

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(missMDA)
library(dummies)
library(stringr)

train <- read.csv("train.csv", stringsAsFactors = F )
test <- read.csv("test.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

train$isTrain <- 1
test$isTrain <- 0
test$Survived <- NA

```

```{r}

#combine all
all <- rbind(train, test)
head(all)
```


# Handling Missing Data
```{r}
#label which entry is NA, then find the mean of all columns
#(true/false can be regarded as 1/0)

#find all character columns
character_col <- unlist(lapply(all, is.character))
#find indexes of columns that are character
char_ind <- which(character_col)

#loop through all character columns and change "" to NA
for (char_col in char_ind){
  regexp <- all[,char_col] == ""
  all[regexp,char_col] <- NA
}

#Do not look at target variable. Testing is missing Survived column. 
missing_dat <- colMeans(is.na(all[,colnames(all)!= "Survived"]))
missing_dat <- sapply(missing_dat, function(x){round(x,4)})
missing_dat <- as.data.frame(missing_dat)
colnames(missing_dat)[1] <- "n"
missing_dat$var <- rownames(missing_dat)

#reset row indexes
rownames(missing_dat) <- NULL

#Bar graph of missing data
ggplot(missing_dat, aes(x = reorder(var, n), y = n)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
    xlab("Variables") +
    ylab("% of Missing Data") +
    ggtitle("Missing Data Graph") +
    coord_flip()  
```


From the above graph, we see only four variables have missing data. We could impute Age, Embarked, and Fare. Cabin has too much missing data (>75%), so this variable will be discarded.


# Remove Missing Data
```{r}
#If column has more than 50% data missing, remove 
missing_dat[which(missing_dat$n > 0.5),] #We are dropping cabin! 

```

```{r}

good_col <- c(missing_dat$var[which(missing_dat$n  < 0.5)],"Survived")
all <- all[,good_col]

```



# Imputing Missing Data
```{r}
#Multiple imputation on quantitative data
all_numeric <- all[,!(colnames(all) %in% c("PassengerId", "Name", "TicketNumber",
                                         "Sex", "Ticket", "Embarked"))]

#Estimate the number of dimensions to compute
nbdim <- estim_ncpPCA(all_numeric)
num.imputed <- MIPCA(all_numeric, ncp = nbdim$ncp, nboot = 1000)

#Create df of imputed values
num_imputed <- num.imputed$res.MI[[1]]

#Extract imputed values and use it in dataset.
all$Age <- num_imputed$Age
all$Fare <- num_imputed$Fare

##No need to impute Embarked, the only categorical variable with missing data, becasue there are only two missing values
#Impute with most common port
print("Frequency Table of Ports")
table(all$Embarked)
```

```{r}
#change NA to most common port
all$Embarked[is.na(all$Embarked)] <- "S"

#Don't look at target variable
missing_dat_preclean <- colMeans(is.na(all[colnames(all) != "Survived" ]))
missing_dat_preclean
paste("Total percentage of missing data:",sum(missing_dat_preclean), "%") 


```
0%! Let's go do some EDA!


# Factorizing Categorical Variables for future EDA visualizations
Also, change 0/1 in target variable to "Died"/"Survived". Change back to numerics for modeling after EDA
```{r}
#####Factorizing variables
all$Survived <- ifelse(all$Survived == 1, "Survived", "Died")
shouldBeCategorical <- c("Pclass", "Embarked", "Survived", "Sex")
for(col in shouldBeCategorical) {
  all[[col]] <- as.factor(all[[col]])
}

#print structure to double check if variables are stored as char, int, or factor appropriately
str(all)
```



# Ticket
There are alpha numeric codes in ticket and varying digit lengths.
Investigate if there's a correlation between digit length of ticket number and survival
```{r}
#make TicketNumber feature
all$TicketNumber <- gsub("([A-Za-z///.0-9]+) ","",all$Ticket)

#make TicketLen feature
all$TicketLen <- nchar(all$TicketNumber)

#make frequency table of ticket number digit lengths and passenger class
ticketnumlen_pclass <- all[all$isTrain == 1,] %>%
  group_by(TicketLen, Pclass) %>%
  count(Survived) 

#Graph 
ggplot(ticketnumlen_pclass, aes(x =factor(TicketLen), y = n, fill = factor(Pclass))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  facet_grid(~Survived) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Length of Digits in Ticket") + 
  ylab("Count of Survived") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Passenger Classes"))

```

Seems that third class passengers with four or 6 digits long have a higher chance of dying. Whereas, first class passengers with 5 digits long have a higher chance of survival.


# Fare
```{r}
hist(all$Fare,main = "Histogram of Fares", xlab = "Fare Amount", col = "green")
#there are negative fares
```
```{r}
#change negative fare to median of fare
all$Fare[all$Fare < 0] <- median(all$Fare)

#side by side hist
#Only look at training set (Testing does not have Survived)
ggplot(all[all$isTrain ==1, ], aes(Fare, fill = Survived)) + 
  geom_histogram(position= "identity") +
  facet_grid(~Survived) + 
  ylab("Passenger Count") +
  ggtitle("Fare Distributions Among Passengers")
```

There seems to be differences in fare distributions. 
Map overlapping histograms for closer analysis
```{r}
#overlapping hist
ggplot(train) +
  geom_histogram(data = subset(train, Survived == 0), aes(Fare, fill = "red"),  alpha = 0.2, bins = 10) +
  geom_histogram(data = subset(train, Survived == 1), aes(Fare, fill = "blue"),  alpha = 0.2, bins = 10) +
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Survived", values = c("red", "blue"), labels = c("Died", "Survived")) +
  ylab("Passenger Count") +
  ggtitle("Fare Distributions")
```

```{r}
#categorize fares
#DO NOT use cuts on entire data. Use cuts derived from training and impose them on testing
cuts <- quantile(all[all$isTrain ==1,]$Fare, probs = seq(0,1,0.20), na.rm = T)
cuts <- round(cuts,2) #NEED TO ROUND. or else factor will just round decimal down.
print("Bins to categorze fares")
cuts
```

```{r}

all$Fare_cat <- factor(cut(all$Fare, cuts, labels = seq(1,5,1),
                           include.lowest = T, right = T))

fare_cat_table <- as.data.frame(table("Fare_cat" = all[all$isTrain == 1,]$Fare_cat,
                        "Survived" = train$Survived))
head(fare_cat_table)
```
```{r}
print("Frequency table of fare categories")
fare_survived <- table("fare_cat" = all$Fare_cat, "Survived" = all$Survived)
fare_survived
summary(fare_survived) #Obvious significant association
```

```{r}
#make labels for graph
fare_cat_labels <- c("<$7.85", "$7.86 - $10.50", "10.51 - $21.70", "$21.71 - $36.69", "$36.69 - Max")

ggplot(all[all$isTrain == 1, ], aes(x = factor(Fare_cat, labels = fare_cat_labels), fill = Survived)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "identity") +
  facet_grid(~Survived) + 
  xlab("Fare Categories") +
  ylab("Count of Passengers") +
  ggtitle("Comparison of Fare Categories") + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Survived")) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust =1))
```
```{r}
#Row percentages per fare category. See the apparent gap
#make relative proportion 
fare_prop_survived <- prop.table(fare_survived, margin = 1)
fare_prop_survived
```

# Sex and Companion
```{r}
sex_sur <- table(all$Sex, all$Survived)
sex_sur
summary(sex_sur) #significant association
```

```{r}
ggplot(all[all$isTrain == 1,], aes(x = Sex, fill = Survived)) +
  geom_bar(stat ="count", position = "identity") + 
  facet_grid(~Survived) + 
  ggtitle("Comparing Survival Counts by Gender") +
  ylab("Passenger Count") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Survived"))

```

Many more males died than females.

# Parch and Sibsp
```{r}
parch_sur <- table("Number of Parents/Children"= all$Parch, all$Survived)
parch_sur
summary(parch_sur) #too significant
```
```{r}

ggplot(all[all$isTrain == 1,], aes(x = Parch, fill = Survived)) +
  geom_bar(stat ="count", position = "identity") + 
  facet_grid(~Survived) + 
  xlab("Number of Parents/Children") + 
  ylab("Passenger Count") +
  ggtitle("Comparing Survival Rate by # of Parents/Children")+
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Survived"))

```

Very similar distribution...seems not informative.
```{r}
ggplot(all[all$isTrain == 1,], aes(x = SibSp, fill = Survived)) +
  geom_bar(stat ="count", position = "identity") + 
  facet_grid(~Survived) + 
  xlab("Number of Siblings/Spouses") + ylab("Passenger Count") +
  ggtitle("Comparing Survival Rate by # of Siblings/Spouses")+
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Survived"))

```

Again, very similar distribution. Combine both variables to make 'Companions' feature

# Make hasCompanions Feature
1 if passenger traveled with a companion
0 if passenger traveled alone
```{r}
all$Companions <- all$Parch + all$SibSp
#make dummy variable
all$hasCompanion <- as.numeric(all$Companions > 0)

ggplot(all[all$isTrain == 1,], aes(x = hasCompanion, fill = Survived)) +
  geom_bar(stat ="count", position = "identity") + 
  facet_grid(~Survived) + 
  xlab("Solo Traveler (0) or Traveled with Companions (1)") +  ylab("Passenger Count") +
  ggtitle("Comparing Survival Rate Among Solo and Non-Solo Travelers")+
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Survived")) 
```

No distinction between solo traveler or those who traveled with companions among those survived. Take a closer look if this variable is correlated with other variables.

```{r}
####See if having a companion is interacting with gender. interaction terms. 
#table(all$Sex, hasCompanion = all$hasCompanion, "Survived" = all$Survived)

ggplot(all[all$isTrain == 1,], aes(x = factor(Sex), fill = factor(hasCompanion, labels = c("Solo", "Traveled w/ Comp.")))) +
  geom_bar(stat ="count", position = "dodge") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  facet_grid(~Survived) + 
  xlab("Gender of Passenger") +  ylab("Passenger Count") +
  ggtitle("Comparing Survival Rate by Solo and Non-Solo Travelers by Gender")+
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Has Companion or Not"))
```
```{r}
#investigate number companions closely to see if we can see more patterns
table(all$Companions, all$Survived)

```

Seems that those with four or more members are more likely to die. 

# Create isSmallFamily Variable
0 if traveled with more than 4 members
1 else
```{r}

#make new variable isSmallFamily

all$isSmallFamily <- 0
all$isSmallFamily[all$Companions >= 4] <- 1

prop.table(table(isSmallFamily = all$isSmallFamily, Survived = all$Survived),1)
```
# Embarked
```{r}
unique(all$Embarked)
embarked_sur <- table(all$Embarked, all$Survived)
embarked_sur 
summary(embarked_sur) #pretty significant.
```
```{r}
ggplot(all[all$isTrain == 1,], aes(x = Embarked, fill = Survived)) +
  geom_bar(stat ="count", position = "identity") + 
  facet_grid(~Survived) + 
  xlab("Port of Embarkment") +  ylab("Passenger Count") +
  ggtitle("Comparing Survival Rate Location of Embarkment")+
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Survived"))
```

Again histograms are very similar.. probably some correlation with another variable

```{r}
#See interaction with Pclass
ggplot(all[all$isTrain == 1,], aes(x = Embarked, fill = factor(Pclass, labels = c("First", "Second", "Third")))) +
  geom_bar(stat ="count", position = "stack") + 
  facet_grid(~Survived) +  
  ylab("Passenger Count") +
  ggtitle("Comparing Survival Rate by Location of Embarkment and Passenger Class")+
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Passenger's Class"))

```

Not much associations.

```{r}
#ANy trends with ticket prices?
#check the mean ticket price per embarked
all %>%
  filter(!is.na(Survived)) %>%
  group_by(Embarked, Survived) %>%
  summarise(mean_price = mean(Fare)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Embarked, y = mean_price, fill = factor(Survived, labels = c("Died", "Survived")))) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity" ) +
    xlab("Location of Embarkment") +
    ylab("Mean Price") +
    ggtitle("Comparing Survival Rate by Location of Embarkment and Passenger Class")+
    facet_grid(~Survived) + 
    guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Survived"))
```

More expensive tickets embarked at Port C while cheapest itckets were at Port Q. 
Let's keep embarked varibable for now. 

# Embarked and Fare_cat
```{r}
#cuts

ggplot(all[all$isTrain == 1,], aes(x = Embarked, fill = factor(Fare_cat, labels = fare_cat_labels))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count", position = "dodge") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  facet_grid(~Survived) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Embarked Port Name") + 
  ylab("Passenger Count") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Fare Categories"))
```

Second cheapest itckets (blue) who embareked at Port S who were more likely to die.
Most expensive tickets(orange) who embarked at Ports C and S were more likely to survive. 
SEcond most expensive ticket (purple) who embarked at Port S "".

```{r}
#Make percentages by port
port_fare_df <- all %>%
  filter(isTrain == 1, !is.na(Embarked)) %>%
  group_by(Embarked, Fare_cat, Survived) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Embarked) %>%
  mutate(embarked_sum = sum(n),
    embarked_percentage = round(n/embarked_sum,2)) 
port_fare_df
  
```
```{r}
ggplot(port_fare_df, aes(x = Embarked,y = embarked_percentage, fill = factor(Fare_cat, labels = fare_cat_labels))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  facet_grid(~Survived) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Embarked Port Name") + 
  ylab("% of Passengers by Ports") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Fare Categories"))
```

Almost the same..only emphasizes certain bars.
Except now, cheapest who embarked at port Q were more likely to die.


# Interaction terms with Embarked and Fare_cat
```{r}
#Make fifteen total interaction terms for 3 embarked * 5 farecat
emb_fare_int <- as.data.frame(matrix(rep(0,nrow(all)*15), nrow = nrow(all), ncol = 15))

col_names <- character()
for (port in c("C", "Q", "S")){
  for(cat in 1:5){
   col_names <-  c(col_names, paste("Embarked",port,":","Fare_cat",cat,sep = ""))
  }
}
#change col names
colnames(emb_fare_int) <- col_names

i = 1
for (port in c("C", "Q", "S")){
  for(cat in 1:5){
    emb_fare_int[i] <- as.numeric(all$Embarked == port & all$Fare_cat == cat)
    i <- i + 1
  }
}


check <- cbind(all[,c("Embarked", "Fare_cat")], emb_fare_int) 
str(check) #ALL GOOD! 

```

Concatenate interaction terms to whole dataset
```{r}
all <- cbind(all, emb_fare_int)

```


# Age
```{r}
ggplot(all[all$isTrain == 1,], aes(x = Age, fill = Survived))+ 
  geom_histogram(bins = 10) + 
  ylab("Passenger Count") +
  ggtitle("Age Distributions")+
  facet_grid(~Survived)
```

There are negative ages! Interesting
```{r}
#Change negative ages to average of age
all$Age[all$Age < 0] <- median(all$Age)


#investigate distribution of young folks who survived
#(notice the small spike on the left hand side)
all %>%
  filter(isTrain == 1 & Age < 18) %>%
  mutate(rounded_age = round(Age)) %>%
  group_by(rounded_age, Survived) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% #still grouped by Age
  mutate(age_group_tot = sum(n),
         age_sur_per = n/age_group_tot) %>%

  ggplot(aes(x = rounded_age,y= age_sur_per, fill = Survived)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    facet_grid(~Survived) +
    xlab("Rounded Age of Child") +
    ylab("% of children in specified age") +
    ggtitle("Age Distributions of Minors")
```

Seems to be bimodal distribution. However, decided to not include the following code because this leads to overfitting. These only account for a small percentage of the data.

```{r}
# #make dummy variable for young kids (< 6 years old)
#   #do not make dummy variable for older teens. may be just samplingn issues.
# all$isAdolescent <- 0
# all$isAdolescent[all$Age <= 6] <- 1
# table("Young child" = all$isAdolescent, all$Survived) #remember, there variety of passengers
# #adding this variable might add a good effect.
#   
```


```{r}
#categorize age
#AGAIN, do NOT make cuts based on entire dataset. 
cuts_age <- quantile(all[all$isTrain ==1, ]$Age, probs = seq(0,1,1/7), na.rm = T)
print("Bins for categorizing age")
cuts_age 

#change lowest min of cuts_age to 0
cuts_age[1] <- 0

cuts_age

age_cat_labels <- c("<16", "16-21", ">21-26", ">26-30", ">30-35", ">35-45", ">45-max(80)")

```

```{r}
#use numeric for data
all$age_cat <- factor(cut(all$Age, cuts_age, labels = seq(1,7,1),
                          include.lowest = T, right = T))
#summary(all$age_cat)
#use age labels for graphing
ggplot(all[all$isTrain == 1,], aes(x = factor(age_cat, labels = age_cat_labels), fill = factor(Pclass, labels = c("First", "Second", "Third")))) +
  geom_bar(stat ="count") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust =1)) +
  xlab("Age Categories") + 
  ylab("Passenger Count") + 
  ggtitle("Comparison of Survival Rate by Age and Passenger Class") + 
  facet_grid(~Survived) + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Passenger Class"))
```


There is again some patterns, but will not look further into this because this will lead to overfitting.

# Name
Investigate names.
```{r}

#Extract the mr. mrs. whatever. 
tail(unique(all$Name))
```

```{r}

# #split ..very messy
# test <- strsplit("Ware, Mr. Frederick", ", ")
# test2 <- strsplit(test[[1]][2], ". ")
# 
# #have to manually delete everything else..not intuitive
# first_names <- sub(pattern = ".*, ", "", x = "ware, Mr. Frederick")
# title <- sub(pattern= "\\. .*", "", x = first_names)
# title

all$name_title <- str_extract(all$Name, pattern = "([A-Za-z]+)\\.")
title <- all %>% group_by(name_title) %>% summarise(n = n()) %>% arrange(desc(n))
#title 


title_surv <- table("Titles" = all$name_title, "Survived" = all$Survived)
title_surv
```
Note that all reverends died. Also the Captain did not survive. (Captain went down with the ship)!
Also there are many titls..let's group them!

```{r}
all$name_title_rev <- gsub(pattern = "Dr.|Col.|Major.|Mlle.|Countess.|Don.|Dona.|Jonkheer.|Lady.|Mme.|Sir.",
                           replacement = "Rare_Nobility", x = all$name_title)
all$name_title_rev <- gsub(pattern = "Ms.", replacement = "Miss.", x = all$name_title_rev)

print("Frequency table of name titles")
table(all$name_title_rev)
```


```{r}
#see correlation between title and survival.

ggplot(all[all$isTrain == 1,], aes(x = name_title_rev, fill = factor(Survived, labels = c("Died", "Survived")))) +
  geom_bar(stat ="count", position = "stack") + 
  facet_grid(~Survived) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust =1)) +
  xlab("Title of Passenger") +  ylab("Passenger Count") + 
  ggtitle("Comparison of Survival Rate by Name Title") + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Survived"))

```

If you're a Mr....You'll probably not survive
```{r}
#Change to numeric so model cna read them

title_levels <- c("Mr.", "Miss.", "Mrs.", "Master.", "Rev.", "Capt.", "Rare_Nobility")
all$title_cat <- factor(all$name_title_rev, levels = title_levels, labels = 1:7)
table(all$title_cat) 
```


# Name and Age
```{r}
#Mister and Age
all %>%
  filter(isTrain == TRUE & title_cat == 1) %>%
  group_by(title_cat, age_cat, Survived) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(age_cat) %>%
  mutate(age_cat_sum = sum(n),
         age_cat_per = round(n/age_cat_sum,2)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(age_cat, labels = age_cat_labels), y = age_cat_per, fill = Survived)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "identity") +
    xlab("Age Categories") +
    ylab("% of Passengers per Age Category") + 
    ggtitle("Comparison of Survival Rate by Age Categories")  +
    guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Survived"))  +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust =1)) +
    facet_grid(~Survived)  
```

This almost shows same pattern as age so no need to make interaction term


# Final Checks
# Make Sex/Embarked variable numeric before modeling
```{r}
#instead of simple 1 0. let's trying using one hot encoding
